Title: International Moon Day: Buzz Aldrin's historic lunar journey currently valued at the same price as 22kgs
Description: An interesting tidbit related to International Moon Day emerged when Buzz Aldrin, the second man to set foot on the Moon, revealed the travel expenses he had claimed for his momentous journey—a mere $33.31.
